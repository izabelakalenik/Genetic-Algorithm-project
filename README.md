# Genetic-Algorithm-project
Project for a Techniques of Effective Programming course - 3rd semester.

The project required writing own method of the Genetic Algorithm, which would find the best solution to the Binary Knapsack Problem.

The main idea of the Genetic Algorithm method is to create a population of randomly selected solutions. 
Then, in accordance with the idea of evolution, we select qualitatively better solutions and cross them with other qualitatively good solutions.
We hope that if the parents were of good quality, then perhaps among their offspring will find one that will be even better.
